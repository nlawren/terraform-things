Learning about and playing around with Hashicorp Terraform. Using it for AWS and local docker work. Also using AWS Cloud9.

Currently working through the Udemy course [More than Certified in Terraform](https://www.udemy.com/share/103Oik3@CEOOsDM63oWzlTXnbpMEhR51qQA4e-I4q3yoCIyubQ5eEuyaDxxqxhZHYYCbVI_T9Q==/) by Derek Morgan.

Completed the Udemy course/exam preparation by Bryan Krausen - [HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate Practice Exam 2023
](https://www.udemy.com/share/102Zak3@Y8YmaIeCM_ItG7Xr4wQhry0JMSlS40z1x9AnK-bhpwGvHye5bL6J5pDsiMq1B8ZXyw==/) and passed successfully. A combination of the hands on terraform course from Derek and then review by the practice exams made getting the Hashicorp Terraform Associate certification easily possible.
