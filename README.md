[![GitHub Super-Linter](https://github.com/nlawren/terraform-things/workflows/Lint%20Code%20Base/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter)

Learning about and playing around with Hashicorp Terraform. Using it for AWS and local docker work. Also using AWS Cloud9.

Currently working through the Udemy course "More than Certified in Terraform" by Derek Morgan.

Completed the Udemy course/exam preparation by Bryan Krausen (https://www.udemy.com/share/102Zak3@Y8YmaIeCM_ItG7Xr4wQhry0JMSlS40z1x9AnK-bhpwGvHye5bL6J5pDsiMq1B8ZXyw==/) and passed successfully. A combination of the hands on terraform course from Derek and then review by the practice exams made getting the Hashicorp Terraform Associate certification easily possible.
