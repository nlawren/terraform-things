# Terraform Things

[![Super-Linter](https://github.com/nlawren/terraform-things/actions/workflows/linter.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter)

Learning about and playing around with Hashicorp Terraform. Using it for AWS and local docker work. Also was previously using AWS Cloud9 (before it was deprecated).

Currently working through the Udemy course [More than Certified in Terraform](https://www.udemy.com/course/terraform-certified/?kw=More+than+certified+i&src=sac) by Derek Morgan.

Completed the Udemy course/exam preparation by Bryan Krausen - [HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate Practice Exam 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/terraform-associate-practice-exam/?kw=Terraform+Associate+Practice+Exam+2023&src=sac) and passed successfully.

A combination of the hands on (more than certified) terraform course from Derek and then knowledge review with the practice exams made getting the Hashicorp Terraform Associate certification significantly easier.

Using Github actions to run both Super Linter lite (for terraform and yaml linting) and dependabot to keep `do-azure-create-appservice` modules up to date.
